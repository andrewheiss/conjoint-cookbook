## 🥇🦍: Note on “golden gorilla” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting, and peer review, I used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to generate an [Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames) internal-to-me project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14).

codename(seed = "conjoint psych", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "golden gorilla"
```

## Colors

The main red color (`#F2274C`) was taken from a standard red/white apron image I found on Google Docs. The other colors are roughly perceptually balanced using HCL hues around that red:

    #2E5BE4  (blue)
    #1AB07A  (green-teal)
    #F2274C  (red)
    #F9A825  (gold)
    #8E44AD  (purple)
